## Installing

#### Windows

1. Download & Extract SFML to **C:/SFML-2.5.1/** where the bin/lib/include folders are contained within
2. Download & Extract MinGW to **C:/mingw32/** where the bin/lib/include folders are contained within

#### MacOS

1. Install "Command Line Tools" in MacOS if they're not already installed (type "xcode-select --install" in terminal)
2. Follow the "Installing SFML" directions here: https://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.5/start-osx.php#installing-sfml

#### Linux

1. Ensure the GCC Toolchain is installed

```bash
sudo apt install build-essential
```

or

```bash
sudo pacman -S base-devel
```

2. Install libsfml

```bash
sudo apt install libsfml-dev
```

or

```bash
sudo pacman -S sfml
```

The SFML version you got will vary depending on the distro. 2.5.1 is included in [Ubuntu 19.04 Disco Dingo](http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/daily-live/current/HEADER.html) for example.

#### All

1. Download & Install Visual Studio Code if you don't already have it.
2. Install the official **C/C++** Extension, reload the window & wait for the dependencies to install.
3. If on Windows, install **Git Bash**, and ensure the **"terminal.integrated.shell.windows"** property in the project's **settings.json** is set to **bash.exe**'s correct location (default: C:/Program Files/Git/bin/bash.exe). We'll be using this for the terminal in our workspace so that the Makefile can run in both Windows, Mac & Linux
4. In **settings.json** Ensure **Path** in the **terminal.integrated.env.windows** object is set to the correct location of the compiler's executable (example: C:\\mingw32\\bin) and the SFML directory is correct as well. Keep in mind Paths should be separated by a semi-colon with no spaces between.

**Note:** You can manage the "Path" environment variable from Windows if you'd like, but I've found sandboxing it in VS Code is better for tracking things like .dll dependencies.

## üîß Running the tests <a name = "tests"></a>

At this point, everything you need is installed

1. Open the **bantumi** folder in VS Code.

2. With Main.cpp (or any source file) open, check the lower-right to ensure "Win32/Mac/Linux" is the configuration set (this should be auto-selected by the C++ plugin). If it is not correct, hit **Ctrl+Shift+B** and select **C/Cpp: Select a configuration...** and choose the platform you're working on.

3. At this point you should be able to run a build task (**Ctrl+Shift+B** > **Build & Run**), but it'll be nicer to add keybindings for these tasks so you can build with 1 keypress.

4. Open the .vscode folder and click on the **\_keybindings.json** file. This is not an officially recognized file, but just contains the keybindings you can copy into the actual keybindings.json file.

5. Go into **File** > **Preferences** > **Keyboard Shortcuts** & click on the keybindings.json link at the top.

6. Copy the keybindings into this file. Feel free to change them if you don't like them later.

7. Hit the **F9** key to run the **Build & Run: Release** task. It should run the Makefile, find the compiler, build the Main.cpp into Main.o, and launch the sample SFML app. **Shift+F9** will launch the basic Debug build, and F8 will launch the actual Debugger alongside the Debug build.

### And coding style tests

Comments must be formatted by leaving a dedicated line within the code, and must be structured like this:

```c++
# this is an example.
```
